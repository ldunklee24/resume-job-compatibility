# resume-job-compatibility

### Overview

This project aims to build an end-to-end system that evaluates how well a candidate’s resume matches a given job description. The goal is to produce a quantitative fit score based on skills, experience, and role alignment using structured job data and natural language processing techniques.

The project is being developed incrementally, starting with robust job description curation and structuring, followed by resume ingestion and model-based matching.
